 This repo has come from a memory system provider called Google Cloud Vertex AI. It is an MCP server and client for integrating with their vector memory backend.

 I want you to migrate it to be a Google vertex vector search MCP tool.  Obviously I want you to migrate any specific language so it's completely specific to Google Vertex and vector search. I want you to check and migrate each function and interface migrating knows that are compatible or deprecating days that aren't keep it simple creating a Migration plan And let me know about any other blockers.

 I will need you to migrate the docs, obviously as well, which are in /docs

Do extremely diligent research initially on the Google Vertex Vector Search API. Ask perplexity to help you explore and recent material. It's critical that all of your input migrations are successful and that we don't include any language that is clearly not adhering to the Vertex Vector Search framework.

Create the migration plan.
